General requirements for the exercise solutions
 - Must support all the major browsers, IE from version 9 and above.

Exercise - Create a responsive table
 - Populate a table using the above endpoints.
 - When the data is loading into the table, show a loading spinner made entirely of CSS code.
 - Put in a deliberate delay of 3 seconds on the table loading (so we can see the loading spinner)
 - Put in a deliberate delay of 3 seconds on loading the details of the first row only (so we can see the loading spinner)
 - The table must indicate that it is possible to expand the “Children” column cell. Doing this should expand a new table inside the existing table with the new data.
 - When the screen width gets below 900 px, hide the "Profession" column.
 - Please feel free to impress us with your coding skills.
